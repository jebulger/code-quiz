# Code Quiz

## About
While on my path to becoming a full-stack web developer, I wanted a way to start to prepare myself for the interview process. It is commonly requested during the process, for the coder being interviewed, to be tasked with some kind of coding assessment. Typically, this assessment is a combination of multiple choice questions/coding tasks. This application goes through a couple of foundational questions about coding and some of the languages, helping the user brush up on some basic coding facts. Throughout the process of building it, I became much more familiar with JavaScript and how it is typed. Since I had never before made an application with JavaScript.
